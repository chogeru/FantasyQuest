Quick help: how to use this asset?
----------------------------------

Edge Fusion is a post-processing effect for Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP) that seamlessly blends edges between objects to eliminate harsh transitions and create smooth, natural-looking scenes.

1) Basic Setup:
  - Ensure your project uses Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
  - Add the Edge Fusion Render Feature to your URP Renderer
  - Create a Global Volume or add Edge Fusion to an existing Volume in your scene

2) Configuring Global Edge Fusion Settings:
  - Select your Volume and add the "Kronnect/Edge Fusion" component
  - Optionally set blend layers to specify which objects should participate in edge fusion
  - Adjust intensity and radius to control the strength and reach of the blending effect
  - Use quality presets to balance performance and visual quality

3) Per-Object Customization:
  - Add the "Edge Fusion Object" component to specific GameObjects for custom settings
  - Set a custom blend radius (0 disables blending for that object)
  - Choose whether to include children objects in the blending effect

4) Advanced Options:
  - Enable "Intra-Object Fusion" to blend edges within the same object based on normal/depth discontinuities
  - Use noise parameters to add natural variation to the blending
  - Enable jitter for temporal anti-aliasing of the effect
  - Use debug modes to visualize different aspects of the edge detection process

5) Performance Optimization:
  - Adjust sample count using quality presets (Very Low to Very High)
  - Set maximum blend distance to limit effect range
  - Use binary search steps for more accurate edge detection
  - Enable Jitter to produce smoother results or disable to improve performance

Universal Rendering Pipeline
----------------------------

Edge Fusion is designed specifically for Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP) on Unity 6.0 or higher.


Future updates
--------------

All our assets follow an incremental development process by which a few beta releases are published on our support forum (kronnect.com).
We encourage you to signup and engage our forum. The forum is the primary support and feature discussions medium.

Of course, all updates of Edge Fusion will be eventually available on the Asset Store.
